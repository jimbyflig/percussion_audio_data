# percussion_audio_data

This is data associated with my senior honors thesis. There are multiple folders with audio 
data in them, which will be described here. Datasets can be described as either "healthy" or
"unhealthy," and a description of each will also be given when the data gathering process is 
described.

# LargeFlange - Between
This folder contains data taken from using a hammer to tap directly on a 17 inch flange, which
has 12 numbered bolts. All of these bolts were tightened to 210 ft-lb, and then one of them was
loosened. After one of the bolts was loosened, the hammer was used to tap on the flange
in the middle of the space between all of the bolts.
